### Variables

Formally, Python is an interpreted language. Meaning, the interpreter receives the command, evaluates that command, and reports the result of that command. Programmer typically defines a series of commands in advance and saves those commands in a plain text file known as source code. For Python, source code is conventionally stored in a file named with the .py suffix. On most operating systems, the Python interpreter can be started by typing `python` or `python3` from the shell / command linе.

In progarmming variable is simply a name for something, like "Johnny Depp" is a name for "a human being who wears scarfs". Variables are just containers which store information and data. Start your shell (or the python IDLE whichever you prefer more). If you're in terminal or powershell type python and you should see `>>>` meaning you've started the python interpreter. Now enter this.`johnny_depp = "a human being who wears scarfs"` hit enter and type `number_of_scarfs = 100` hit enter. In this case `johnny_depp` and `number_of_scarfs` are the names of your variables, you've declared them as variables by using `=` syntax. Now type in the variable name and hit enter to see what's contained in it.

Within all programming languages there are many different types of variables. These are the types of variables in python.
