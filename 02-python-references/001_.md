### Variables

Formally, Python is an interpreted language. Meaning, the interpreter receives the command, evaluates that command, and reports the result of that command. Programmer typically defines a series of commands in advance and saves those commands in a plain text file known as source code. For Python, source code is conventionally stored in a file named with the .py suffix. On most operating systems, the Python interpreter can be started by typing `python` or `python3` from the shell / command linе.

In progarmming variable is simply a name for something, like "Johnny Depp" is a name for "a human being who wears scarfs". Variables are just containers which store information and data. Start your shell (or the python IDLE whichever you prefer more). If you're in terminal or powershell type python and you should see `>>>` meaning you've started the python interpreter. Now enter this.`johnny_depp = "a human being who wears scarfs"` hit enter and type `number_of_scarfs = 100` hit enter. In this case `johnny_depp` and `number_of_scarfs` are the names of your variables, you've declared them as variables by using `=` syntax. Now type in the variable name and hit enter to see what's contained in it.

Within all programming languages there are many different types of variables. 
These are the basic types of variables in python.

Class | Description | Immutable?
------|-------------|----------
`bool`| Boolean value | ✓
`int` | integer (arbitrary magnitude) | ✓
`float` | floating-point number | ✓
`list` | mutable sequence of objects |
`tuple` | immutable sequence of objects | ✓
`str` | character string | ✓
`set` | unordered set of distinct objects |
`frozenset` | immutable form of set class | ✓
`dict` | associative mapping (dictionary) | 

Boolean values can be either `True` or `False`. Integer variables are just whole numbers `number_of_scarfs` was that kind of variable, floats are decimal numbers. String variables are any text information, basic collection of charactr objects, you declare them in quotation marks e.g. `johnny_depp` was a string variable. We'll get to the rest later on. In contrast to many other programming languages, in python, you don't have to know the type of a variable you're creating, you simply declare it with `=` syntax. But it's better you remember the type of the variable you've created. If you type in your shell `type(johnny_depp)` it'll tell you it's a string, and if you type in `type(number_of_scarfs)` it'll tell you it's an integer. If you type in `johnny_depp + number_of_scarfs` it'll give you an error, but if you type in `number_of_scarfs + 1` or `johnny_depp + " while sleeping"` it'll return a result.

These are different kinds of python expressions and operators in precedence

Precedence |Type | Symbols|
--|-----|-----------------------
1 | member access | `expr.member`
2 | function/method calls | `expr(...)`
 | cibtauber subscripts/slices | `expr[...]`
3 | exponentation | `**`
4 | unary operators | `+expr, -expr, ~expr`
5 | multiplication, division | `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`
6 | addition, subtraction | `+`, `-`
7 | bitwise shifting | `<<`, `>>`
8 | bitwise-and | `&`
9 | bitwise-xor | `^`
10 | bitwise-or | `|`
11 | comparisons | `is`, `is not`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
 | containment | `in`, `not in`
12 | logical-not | `not expr`
13 | logical-and | `and`
14 | Logical-or | `or`
15 | conditional | `val1 if cond else val2`
16 | assignments | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.
